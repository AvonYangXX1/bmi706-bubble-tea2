# Influenza Data Visualization Dashboard

## Overview
This project provides an interactive dashboard for visualizing influenza data across different regions, subtypes, and time periods. It allows users to explore trends in positive samples of influenza, track the positive rates, and compare influenza subtypes across countries, hemispheres, and WHO regions. The dashboard is built using Streamlit and leverages Altair and Plotly for data visualization.
